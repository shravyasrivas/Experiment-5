# Experiment 5: Study of Dictionaries In Python

---

### Aim: Study Of Dictionaries In Python

---

### Algorithms




#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 1:

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a dictionary that stores product names as keys and their prices as values.

Step 3: Select the product whose price needs to be updated.

Step 4: Update the price of the selected product using the key.

Step 5: Display the updated dictionary.

Step 6: Stop.

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 2:

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a dictionary that stores student names as keys and their marks as values.

Step 3: Accept the student name from the user using the input command.

Step 4: Search for the entered name in the dictionary using the `get()` method.

Step 5: If the student name is found, display the corresponding marks.

Step 6: If the student name is not found, display the message "Student not found".

Step 7: Stop.

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 3:

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a dictionary that stores usernames as keys and passwords as values.

Step 3: Accept the username from the user using the input command.

Step 4: Accept the password from the user using the input command.

Step 5: Retrieve the password corresponding to the entered username using the `get()` method.

Step 6: Compare the entered password with the stored password.

Step 7: If both passwords match, print **"Login successful"**, otherwise print **"Login failed"**.

Step 8: Stop.

#### Algorithm for Problem Statement 4:

Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Create a dictionary that stores student names as keys and their marks as values.

Step 3: Use the `max()` function with `key = dictionary.get` to find the student with the highest marks.

Step 4: Store the result in a variable.

Step 5: Display the name of the student who scored the highest marks.

Step 6: Stop.

### Theory

A **dictionary** in Python is a collection of data stored in **key–value pairs**. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}`. Each key in a dictionary is unique and is used to access its corresponding value.

During this experiment, the following concepts were studied:

#### Properties and Methods:

* **Key–Value Storage**: Data is stored as a pair consisting of a key and its associated value.
* **Unique Keys**: Dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys. If duplicate keys are used, the latest value overwrites the previous one.
* **Mutable Nature**: Dictionaries are mutable, meaning values can be modified after creation.
* **Access Using Keys**: Values in a dictionary are accessed using keys instead of index numbers.
* **get() Method**: Used to safely retrieve the value associated with a key without causing an error.

#### Functions:

* **max()**: Used to find the key corresponding to the highest value in the dictionary.
* **len()**: Returns the total number of key–value pairs in the dictionary.
* **type()**: Returns the data type of the dictionary.
* **get()**: Retrieves the value for a specified key.

### Conclusion

Through this experiment, the working of dictionaries in Python was successfully studied. It was observed that dictionaries efficiently store data in key–value format and allow fast data retrieval using keys. By implementing login validation and finding the highest marks, the practical applications of dictionaries were clearly understood.
